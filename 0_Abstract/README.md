## **1 About Wiper Control System**

## **1.1 Abstract**

A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage. As a result, this system is proposed to address these issues. The goals of this project are to provide wiping systems for older cars, to improve the system by employing actuators and pull switches (using the same switch for multiple purposes by stepwise switching), and to regulate the engine and wiper speed with a single switch.

## **1.2 Description**

Wiper Control System is an electronic device that replaces the traditional wiper blade in automobiles. In this system, we will use a single switch to control the ignition button (on the motor) in the ACC position. As a first press, turn on the wiper system by pressing the button a second time, change the wiper speed by pressing the button a third time, and turn off the motor by pressing the button a fourth time. All of this was accomplished using LEDs in a simulation tool.
