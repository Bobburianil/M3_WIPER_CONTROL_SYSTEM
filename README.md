# M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM
# INTRDUCTION
The wiper system is a utility of the  project. It is used to clean  car windshields both front and rear. Wipers work by removing oil, dust, rainwater and dirt. Smashed against the windshield and swingarm powered by the engine. Hot gears can generate the force needed to move the wipers as fast as they need to move. . Nowadays we have  automatic wiper control whenever we stop wiping  between processes it will automatically return to the original position. This is the new wiper system as it is in the wiper arm. Car wipers are already on the  market today. are manual systems that operate on the principle of manual switching. Our proposed system has an automatic wiper system that automatically turns on the wipers when it detects rain and stops the wipers when the rain stops. This system makes the driver's job easier by eliminating  manual human intervention to activate the windshield wipers, thus contributing to increased ride comfort drive.
This wiper speed control system is used in all types of cars and its main function is to remove raindrops from the  front glass of the vehicle. Because driving the car in the rain is quite difficult, we will use the wipers to clean the front glass of the car, which is the mirror so that we can drive  even in the rain.
