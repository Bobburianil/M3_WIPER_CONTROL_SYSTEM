# M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM
# INTRDUCTION
The utility project is a wiper controlÂ system. It is used to clean the car's front and rear wind shields. Wiper removes oil, dust, rain water, and grime. The wind shield is struck, and the motor provides the arm. Warm clothing can produce the force needed to move the wipers as quickly as they need to move. We now have an automatic wiper control that returns to its original position if we stop wiping in the middle of the procedure. This is the new wiper system hidden underneath the wiper arm. The car wipers on the market now are manual devices that work on the premise of manual switching. Our suggested system offers an automatic wiper system that turns on the wiper when rain is detected and turns off the wiper when the rain stops. This device makes it easier for the driver by reducing the need for manual human interaction to initiate wiper operation, resulting in more comfortable driving. The principal function of this Wiper Speed Control System, which is used in all types of automobiles, is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen. Because driving a vehicle in the rain is tough, we'll use wipers to clean the vehicle's front screen, which is a mirror, so we can drive it even in the rain.
